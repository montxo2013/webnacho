# Biography

I am a professor of statistics at the Department of Statistics at Universidad de la República (IESTA-UdelaR). I've completed my PhD degree in July 2017 working with Jarad Niemi. I am interesting in Bayesian methods, particularly in high dimensional hierarchical models and approximate Bayesian computation.
