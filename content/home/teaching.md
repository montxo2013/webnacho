I am teaching "Bayesian inference" course at Universidad de la República. The course is the second course of statistical inference in the undergrad program in statistics. The main goal is to introduce Beysian methods to data analysis.   

In the past, I have being involved as assistant in several statistics courses, both in Iowa State University (ISU) and Universidad de la República (UdelaR).

**Previous teaching experience:**

* STAT 401: Statistical methods for research workers (TA, Fall 2016, ISU)
* Statistics II (TA, 2005 - 2007, UdelaR)
* Time Series (TA, 2011, UdelaR)
* Multivariate methods (TA, 2010, UdelaR)
